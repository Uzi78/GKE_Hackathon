# 🌍 Travel & Culture-Aware Shopping Chatbot  

## 📌 Overview
This project introduces a shopping chatbot that enhances the Online Boutique demo application with cultural and travel awareness.  

The chatbot helps users discover products in a more personalized way by considering their travel plans, cultural context, and seasonal events. Instead of just browsing a catalog, users can ask natural questions, and the chatbot provides recommendations with meaningful explanations.
