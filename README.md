- **Configuration Management** - Environment-based config for different stages

### Deploy to GKE

```bash
# Build and push containers
docker build -t gcr.io/YOUR-PROJECT/travel-chatbot-backend .
docker push gcr.io/YOUR-PROJECT/travel-chatbot-backend

docker build -t gcr.io/YOUR-PROJECT/travel-chatbot-frontend -f Dockerfile.frontend .
docker push gcr.io/YOUR-PROJECT/travel-chatbot-frontend

# Apply Kubernetes manifests
kubectl apply -f k8s/

# Get external IP
kubectl get services
```

### Scalability Features
- **Async Processing** - Non-blocking API calls
- **Caching Layers** - Reduced external API dependency  
- **Graceful Degradation** - Fallback systems for service failures
- **Load Balancing Ready** - Stateless service design
